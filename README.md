# DS-4002-Group-Project: TEAM SBT


## Section 1: Software and Platform Used

### Software:
- **R**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **R Studio**: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to code and build both the BSTS and SAMIRA model.
- **Chicago Data Portal Query**: THe Query function in the CHicago Data Portal, where we got our data from, was used to filter out for the coulmns and data we used.

  When conducting our analysis to assess which time series predictive model best predicts future ridership, we will employ two predictive models: a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model and a Bayesian Structure Time Series (BSTS) model.
  
### Add-on Packages:
- **Batesisn Structure Time Sereies (BSTS)**: This is a package for a specific time sereice predctive model that is found in R, whihc we used to build one of our predtivie models.
- **Seasonal Autoagressive Integrated Moving Average (SAMIRA)**: This is a pacakge for a specfic time sereies predivtive modesl that is found in R, which we used to build one of our predtive models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization, including histograms and box plots.

### Platform:
- **Mac** and **Windows**: These operating systems were used during development.

‚óè Section 3: Instructions for reproducing your results. In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed #and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.
